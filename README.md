AwesomeMatlabAerospaceResourcesOnline (AMARO)

This is a list of Aerospace Engineering, System Modeling, related resources, projects, and some models for MATLAB that I’ve found. I put this list together to create a comprehensive list for attitude determination control systems (ADCS), flight dynamics, and similar modeling processes to use in MATLAB and Simulink.

I haven’t actually used all the libraries on this list, so I can’t vouch for their quality. I’m just noting their existence.

Submissions to this list are welcome. Make a Pull Request with them.
