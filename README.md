AwesomeMatlabAerospaceResourcesOnline (AMARO)

This is a list of Aerospace Engineering, Modeling, and related resources, projects, and models for Matlab that I’ve found. I put this list together to create a comprehensive list for attitude determination control system (ADCS) Matlab and Simulink software along with other topics. 

I haven’t actually used all the libraries on this list, so I can’t vouch for their quality. I’m just noting their existence.

Submissions to this list are welcome. Make a Pull Request with them.
