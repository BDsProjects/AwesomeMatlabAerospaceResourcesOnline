AwesomeMatlabAerospaceResourcesOnline (AMARO)

This is a list of Aerospace Engineering, System Modeling, related resources, projects, and some models for MATLAB that I’ve found. I put this list together to create a comprehensive list for attitude determination control systems (ADCS), flight dynamics, and similar modeling processes to use in MATLAB and Simulink.

I haven’t actually used all the libraries on this list, so I can’t vouch for their quality. I’m just noting their existence.

Submissions to this list are welcome. Make a Pull Request with them.

### Spacecraft Modeling Papers and Textbooks
- - [Spaceflight Dynamics: Third Edition 3rd ed. Edition](https://a.co/d/4di37rW) - Spaceflight Dynamics: 3rd Edition by William E. Wiesel is likely the most easy to read textbook I have ever had in my undergrad and graduate studies. Covers mainly orbital mechanics and dynamics instead of control systems or ADCS, but it helped me to understand the orbital environment well.
  - [Spacecraft Modeling, Attitude Determination, and Control: Quaternion-Based Approach by Yaguang Yang](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20240009554/downloads/Space%20Attitude%20Development%20Control.pdf) - NASA Technical Reports Server listed, Quaternion based attitude determination and control textbook with the best explanations of quaternion theory, use, and integration I have come across.
  - [A Model-Based Design & Testing Approach for Orion GN&C Flight Software Development by Joel Henry NASA-JSC](https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/01-03_orion_cre_exploration_vehicle_model_0.pdf) - A presentation on the MBSE process for the Artemis Mission Capsule, Orion's flight software development.
  - [MIT Open courseware - Lecture L17 - Orbit Transfers and Interplanetary Trajectories](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/16-07-dynamics-fall-2009/e6393974ce4ed22b095f2e1d1a6a8e81_MIT16_07F09_Lec17.pdf) - Transfers from one orbit to another and the construction of interplanetary trajectories
